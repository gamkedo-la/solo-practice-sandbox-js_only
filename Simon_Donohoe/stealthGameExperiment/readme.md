Using what I've learned from the course games to build out a test for an overhead stealth game. The objective is to get to the goal by staying out of the enemy's line of sight

Copied the warriorGame files as a starting point

Initially
-one room
-one enemy that will rotate
  -some indication which way the enemy is facing
-a start point at one end and a goal at the other
-obstacles to hide behind, to stay out of the enemy's line of sight
-the player will have to move from cover to cover to get to the goal without being spotted by the enemy

Have
-a room
-the player on one end
-a goal at the other end
