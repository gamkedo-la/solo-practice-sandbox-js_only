Using what I've learned from the course games to build out a test for an overhead stealth game. The objective is to get to the goal by staying out of the enemy's line of sight

Initially it will have
-one room
-one enemy that will rotate
  -some indication which way the enemy is facing
-a start point at one end and a goal at the other
-obstacles to hide behind, to stay out of the enemy's line of sight
-the player will have to move from cover to cover to get to the goal without being spotted by the enemy
