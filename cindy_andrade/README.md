# Educational Game Prototype

Hello! I'm creating this folder as a sandbox to create an "educational" game in the future. Educational meaning that I can imagine students and teachers using the game in the classroom for fun learning. The subject could be math, coding, etc. 

## The Why
I am passionate about education and math. Math should be fun and accessible to everyone! 
If I could help contribute to at least one person enjoying a "math" game, that would be awesome.

## The What
I'm not sure what this math/educational game will look like yet but if you want to collaborate on a future HomeTeam game with this purpose, feel free to reach out to me at cindyandcode@gmail.com.

## Potential Ideas
<ul>
    <li>A learn-CSS game in the form of interior design for helping customers.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>This was inspired by seeing my 6th grade students enjoying a game where they create cupcakes to sell to customers with strange mathematical requests. <a href="https://i-ready.fandom.com/wiki/Cupcake">Link to information about referenced game</a></li>
            <li>Idea: You are working for a design company where customers come in. They don't know exactly what they want yet, but you write out CSS code to show them examples of what is possible. They may bring in color swatches, fonts they like, etc. Then, you write out code to match what they want.</li>
            <li>Art style: cutesy, anime, cartoon, bright or pastel colors</li>
            <li>Music style: Muzak, cafe, elevator, etc.</li>
        </ul>
    <li>A Math game where students test their mental math by answering quick maths questions to earn energy to ________.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>The blank could be: shoot monsters out of the sky; run away from something; race against a friend - who can get the high score of fastest time</li>
        </ul>
</ul>
